Run a personal VPN in the cloud. And _rotate_ it regularly.

VPN servers are a great way to hide your activity from the prying eyes of ISPs
and obfuscate your location. But it's better to run your own VPN than to pay
for a service, since the VPN service may be tracking you too. However, setting
up a VPN is difficult. Add to that, it's probably wise to change the IP address
of your VPN after a while. Usually, this means tearing the existing server down
and standing up a new one in its place.

**rotvpn** is a pure Python utility that sets up a
[WireGuard](https://github.com/WireGuard/WireGuard) full tunnel VPN with DNS (via
[unbound](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound)). It is designed to be
ephemeral, so you can rotate to a new server with a single command.

_Currently, only [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) are supported. Other providers may be added in the future... Got a favorite? Feel free to send a patch!_

# Installation

**rotvpn** installs and runs from your workstation.

You must have `python3` in your path. You will need to create a virtual
environment and install the dependencies:

```
python3 -m venv .env                                               # create the virtualenv
source .env/bin/activate                                           # start it up
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip                               # upgrade installer
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt                         # install requirements
```

# Running

After you've installed the Python3 dependencies, you're ready to run your own VPN. Almost. Depending on which provider you use (Digitalocean is the default), you will need to export some variables into the environment.

### Digitalocean

You'll need to get a [DigitalOcean API token](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens). Export it into your environment:

```
export ROT_DO_TOKEN=123abc...
```

And you're ready to go.

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)

You need an account ID, secret, and region, and you will need to export them into your environment like so:

```
export ROT_AWS_ID=AKI...
export ROT_AWS_SECRET=WM0...
export ROT_AWS_REGION=us-west-2
```

After that, you can run `rotvpn.py`.

### Actually run it

If the two steps above are complete, you're ready to go. Make sure you're running in your virtualenv, and in the root of this repo. Then do something like

```
python3 rotvpn.py --name my-cool-vpn
```

After the script runs, you should have a file named `peer-tunnel-configs-<PROVIDER>-<NAME>.zip`. `<PROVIDER>` will be one of the providers above, and `<NAME>` will be whatever you gave rotvpn in the `--name` parameter. Unzip and you will have 10 peer configurations.


Here is the usage for the script:

```
> python3 rotvpn.py --help

usage: rotvpn.py [-h] [--provider PROVIDER] [--name NAME] [--do DO]
                 [--config CONFIG]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --provider PROVIDER  Specify the provider, i.e. digitalocean
  --name NAME          A name for your deploy, like 'mycoolvpn'. Lets you have
                       multiple deploys for a provider.
  --do DO              Provision or remove your VPN: --do provision | --do
                       remove
  --config CONFIG      Optional JSON config for your provider

```

The `--name` parameter is the only one that is required. **rotvpn** defaults to
DigitalOcean for `--provider` and the default `--do` action is `provision`. Any
time you run the prior command, any existing server matching `--name` will be
deleted, and a new server deployed with a new set of client configs
(`peer-tunnel-configs.zip`)

Providers may have additional configuration fields they accept. If they do, you
can use the `--config` parameter to pass in that information. For instance, the
DigitalOcean provider defaults to the `sfo2` region, and the `s-1vcpu-1gb`
(smallest) sized droplet. If you want to change that, you can do something like:

```
python3 rotvpn.py --name myvpn --config '{"region":"ams3", "size":"s-1vcpu-2gb-amd"}'
```

AWS currently supports changing the size of your instance. It defaults to `ts.micro`. You can modify this via `--config`, e.g.

```
python3 rotvpn.py --provider aws --name my-cool-vpn --config '{"size":"t2.medium"}'
```

If you're done with the VPN for a while, you can simply remove it, and save
some money until you need it again:

```
python3 rotvpn.py --name my-cool-vpn --do remove
```

# Client configuration

## MacOS

Install the [WireGuard](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025?mt=12) client from the App Store.

Open it and click 'Import tunnel(s) from file'.

Select one of the files unzipped from `peer-tunnel-configs.zip`.

It will load in your WireGuard client interface:

Click 'Activate'. Test your connection and IP address.
